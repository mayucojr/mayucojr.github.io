NOTE FROM MARIO: Kellie from BPM Wellness (a black owned, comunity oriented fitness studio in Miami) asked me if I wanted to do somehting for Basel in their space in August. At the time they were renting out a former event space and photography studio with infinity walls, 20 foot ceilings, and long white hallways everyhwere. It was a dream space for a performance pop up. 

Smita and I had met the year before when I wrote a profile on her for Miami New Times ahead of her solo exhibition at MOCA North Miami.
